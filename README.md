# 🎛️ RC-505 MKII Clone with Raspberry Pi 4

This project aims to recreate the functionality of the BOSS RC-505 MKII Loop Station using a Raspberry Pi 4.
It is an experimental open-source attempt to design a customizable, software-driven alternative to a professional looper.

## ✨ Features (Planned / Work in Progress)

- 🎶 Multi-track audio looping (similar to RC-505 MKII)

- 🎤 Real-time recording, overdubbing, and playback

- ⏱️ Adjustable BPM and quantization

- 🎚️ Effects engine (EQ, filters, delays, etc.)

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- 🖥️ Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB recommended)

- 🎧 USB audio interface (low latency)

- 🔌 Power supply and storage (microSD or SSD)

## 💻 Software Requirements

- 🐧 Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)

- 🐍 Python 3.x

- 🎵 JACK / ALSA for low-latency audio

- 📦 Required libraries (to be detailed later)

## 🚀 Installation

(Instructions will be added as the project evolves.)

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rc505-rpi4.git
cd rc505-rpi4
# setup steps to be defined
```

# 🗺️ Roadmap

- 🎶 Core audio loop engine

- ⏱️ Track synchronization & quantization
